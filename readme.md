This is a simple animixplay remake that i did, its not that gud but i just wanted to make it for the memories!

[Site launch](http://animixplay.great-site.net/), go check it out and if there's any issue, you could report them here!

Note* : 
the site is still on development so there might be couple of bugs/issues!

# Hosting
For now, i plan to keep the code private and when its fully done, i might publish the code public
